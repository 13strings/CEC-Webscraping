# CEC-Webscraping
For my internship to help automate a variety of search-related tasks to reduce time spent for me and for future interns.

Modeled after light-bulb research for manufacturers, but can be expanded to other product types with simple research. This will be explored in later iterations of the code (Hopefully!!). :)
